# Data Science Fem - Two first Challenges

_This project shows the main aspects to build a web page from 0_

## python if else üöÄ

_This was about using conditionals for this **conditions**._
```
if number is odd print Weird
if number is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
if number is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 , print Weird
If number is even and greater than 20 prin Not Weird
```
I just base on the fact a mod of 2 always is a even number and create conditions.

You have to test in order to know possible edge cases.

## Minions Game üçå

_This was about using conditionals, loops and index for this **conditions**._

Stuart and Kevin can play a game, this consist that if a word is given and they can create sub-string from that word.  But Stuart has to star a new sub-string with consonants and Kevin with vocal.

### Brainstorming üìã
The firs ideas was pop out the letter of the list, but it was a lot oftime complex.

The first solution involves slices in the index for take the substring correspondent. Bit the  system was time out

The second use a rest in order to found the thotal consosnants in the word, in the case of Stuart, and vocals in the case of Kevin.

I use ord because I like use the decimal ASCII of the chars.

The test take me out a lot of time because some time out.
